                     <h3>Joe Rogan</h3>

                           <p>Joe Rogan is a controversial character for some, he's a Comedian, podcast host, and a UFC commentator. 
                              He's a really interseting person, listening to hundreds of hours of his podcast you really kind of get a feel for who he is as a person.
                              Joe always keeps and open mind and really enjoys a challenge, he is very honest with everyone and lives a life that makes him happy and keeps his family happy.
                              Joe has not only inspired me but hundreds if not thousands of other people to get out and try new things, you only have one life and you have to live it to the fullest.
                              I respect him and he's an inspiration to me, because he makes a living off of just being a nice, humble, and driven individual that you can't help but to admire.

                     <h3>Cameron Hanes</h3>
                        <figure>

                           <p>Cam Hanes, is the most successful bow hunter in the world, and a very successful ultrarunner, as well as a family man with a day job.
                              He runs ultra marathons notably running 102 miles in 24 hours, he runs a marathon a day before he goes to his 9-5 job.
                              Cam still finds time for his family and practicing shots with his bow as well as lifting weights.
                              After running and work he goes home to his family where he lifts weights and practices with his bow, his real passion is hunting.
                              He hasn't had an unsucessful hunt since 2009, which is what makes him the most successful bow hunter in the world.
                              I respect him, because his drive is almost inhuman, he strives to be the best in anything he does, this quality is inspirational for thousands of people across the globe
                              including me. I have taken up bow hunting and running due to Cam Hanes, and I love every second of it.

                     <h4>David Goggins</h4>

                           <p>Daivd Goggins is an ex Navy Seal, ultrarunner and challenges himself as much as he can daily to push past his previous limits.
                              He is an extremely driven and motivated indivdual who can make even the most discplined and active people feel like they're not doing enough.
                              Hes won a multitude of marathons and ultra marathons, as well as writing a book and adding constant new challenges to his day to day routine.
                              He also has accomplished so much in life, while over coming so many challanges such as childhood envrioment, heart surgery, and being overweight for a long time.
                              I respect him, because he's extremely motivated and driven and when you listen to him speak you can't help but feel some of his drive and determination rub off on you.

                     <h4>Barack Obama</h4>
                        <figure>
                           <img src="images/obama.jpg" width="300" height="300">

                           <p>Barack Obama has always been a symbol to me of someone who is strong, calm, collected, and intelligent.
                              He faced so much adversity while he was running for president and afterwards, nothing stopped him and following his dream of becoming the President Of The United States.
                              Obama will go down in histroy as the first African-American president and he will also go down as one of the kindest, genuine presidents, he made tough decisions and did best with the tools he was given.
                              He had the commonwealth of the nation in mind whenever he made a decision and for this I respect him.

                     <h4>Bernie Sanders</h4>
                        <figure>
                           <img src="images/bernie.jpg" width="500" height="300">
                        </figure>
                           <p>People call him a radical, a socialist, and a cook, but through all the adversity and the brigades of insults and hurdles thrown his way he's never stopped fighting for the American people.
                              Bernie has been fighting for the people of the nation long before I was even born, protesting segregation, gay rights, corporate greed, and social programs for the common people.
                              Sanders wants the best for his nation, he understands the struggles of some of the poorest people in the nation and he doesn't believe or current system fights for these people, instead it rewards the top 1% of wealth.
                              I hope that he wins the presidency this upcoming election, but I do of course have my doubts.
                              I think his policies will greatly improve day to day life for the average citizen, I really hope some of them can come to fruition and we can move towards where the rest of the world is already at as far as social programs and climate change are concerned.
                              I respect Bernie Sanders for standing up for the small guy, and for what he believes in, as well as never giving up in his long battle for the people of our nation.
